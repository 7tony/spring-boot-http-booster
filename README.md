# Introduction

This project exposes a simple REST endpoint where the service `greeting` is available at this address `http://hostname:port/greeting` and returns a json Greeting message

```
{
    "content": "Hello, World!",
    "id": 1
}

```

The id of the message is incremented for each request. To customize the message, you can pass as parameter the name of the person that you want to send your greeting.

```
http http://localhost:8080/greeting name==charles
curl http://localhost:8080/greeting -d name=James
```

The project bundles the Apache Tomcat 8.0.36 artifacts with SpringBoot 1.4.1.RELEASE. It can be used with the Apache Tomcat Red Hat Jar or the files
proposed by the Apache Tomcat Community project. The by default profile will use the Red Hat jar files but you can also make a test using the community files

```
mvn clean install -Predhat (default profile)
```

```
mvn clean install -Pcommunity
```

# OpenShift

The Project can be build top of Openshift using minishift tool. For that purpose, you will use the profile `openshift` which has been 
configured to use the Fabric8 Maven plugin.

```
minishift start
minishift docker-env
oc login --user admin --password admin
mvn clean install -Popenshift -Predhat
```

Remark : To use the official Red Hat S2I image, then we must configure the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to use the Java S2I image with this parameter `-Dfabric8.generator.from=registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-fuse-6/fis-java-openshift`

Next we can deploy the POD and test it

```
mvn -Popenshift -Predhat fabric8:deploy
```

Then, you can test the service deployed in OpenShift and get a response message 

```
http $(minishift service rest --url=true)/greeting
```

To test the project against OpenShift using Arquillian, simply run this command

```
mvn test -Popenshift -Predhat
```

# Using OpenShift Pipeline (optional)

In order to use the Pipleine Strategy supported by OpenShift for the build process, the server Jenkins should be installed. That should be
the case when you will use Openshift Enterprise. If this is not the case, please use the following instructions to install it

```
echo "Add the template containing Openshift Jenkins"
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/jenkins-ephemeral-template.json -n openshift

echo "Deploy Jenkins (without persistence)"
oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
```

Remark : The login/password to be used to access the Jenkins Server is admin/password

Next we can build the project and deploy it on Openshift using the profile `openshift-pipeline`. During the fabric8 build process, a `BuildConfig` file will be created
containing the description of the Jenkins script to be executed within a job.

```
node('master') {
  stage 'build'
  openshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'rest-s2i', showBuildLogs: 'true')
  stage 'deploy'
  openshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'rest')
}
```

Next, this buildConfig file can be used and launched from the OpenShift Web Console or using this openshift command

`oc start-build rest-build`


# Launch and test

To start Spring Boot using the embedded Aopache Tomcat jar files, run the following commands in order to start the maven goal of Spring Boot

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If the application has been launched without any error, you can access the REST endpoint exposed using curl or httpie tool

```
http http://localhost:8080/greeting
curl http://localhost:8080/greeting
```

# Health

In order to monitor and manage the HTTP Service, this project uses [Spring ActuatorÂ°(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-actuator).
To discover what is the status of the REST endpoint, you will issue this request 

```
curl $(minishift service rest --url=true)/health
```

Using the command defined hereafter, you can watch all the resources deployed and query them individually like `/metrics, /env, /dump, /configprops, /beans or /health`

```
curl $(minishift service rest --url=true)/mappings
```

It is also possible to use directly the Jolokia HTTP bridge to quety the JMX Mbeans. Here is an example of such request using the IP address of the Spring Boot service 
deployed on OpenShift to collect the metrics of the application

```
http 'http://192.168.64.56:31065/jolokia/exec/org.springframework.boot:type=Endpoint,name=metricsEndpoint/getData()'
```
